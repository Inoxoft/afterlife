## ✨ Overview

Afterlife lets you build lifelike conversational agents from real humans — living or gone. Feed it documents, diaries, emails, transcripts, or just interview someone. Then it builds a portable, flexible digital twin you can talk to. 

## 🎭 The Concept of Masks

</p>

In Afterlife, the AI doesn't channel the actual consciousness of historical figures. Instead, think of each AI model as a highly advanced digital actor wearing a "mask." This mask is meticulously crafted from historical data, writings, and known personality traits of the figure it represents.

- **Digital Actors**: The AI embodies the persona, speech patterns, and knowledge base of the historical figure.
- **Immersive Portrayals**: The goal is to provide an immersive and educational experience, allowing you to interact with a believable representation.
- **Not Actual Consciousness**: It's important to remember that you are conversing with a sophisticated AI program designed to simulate these personalities, not their actual preserved consciousness.

This approach allows for a respectful and engaging way to explore history and the minds of those who shaped it.
