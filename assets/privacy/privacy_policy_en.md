Last updated: 2025-10-02

Thank you for using Afterlife. Your privacy matters. This policy explains what data we process, how we use it, and the choices you have.

1. What We Process
- Usage data: in‑app interactions, basic diagnostics and crash logs (if enabled by the OS).
- Content you provide: messages, character profiles, uploaded files for processing.
- Settings: language and basic app preferences.

2. Where Your Data Lives
- On‑device only: chat history, settings, and generated character data are stored on your device using secure app storage.
- We do not run our own cloud back end for user content and we do not transmit your chats to external AI services.

3. Apple Intelligence (On‑device)
- Processing happens entirely on your iPhone using Apple Foundation Models (iOS 26+). Your conversations are not sent to a server.

4. API Keys
- Not applicable in the current iOS release. The app does not require third‑party API keys.

5. Files You Upload
- You may import files (e.g., PDF/TXT/DOC/DOCX/EML) to generate character cards. Files are processed on‑device; we do not upload your files to our servers.

6. Data Retention
- On‑device data persists until you delete it from Settings or uninstall the app.

7. Sharing
- We do not sell your personal data.
- We do not share your conversations or files with third parties.

8. Security
- We use platform storage and recommended practices to protect local data.

9. Your Choices
- Clear all local data in Settings > Data Management.

We may update this policy. We will update the “Last updated” date above and may provide in‑app notice of material changes.
