Afterlife Privacy Policy (EN)

Last updated: 2025-08-27

Thank you for using Afterlife. Your privacy matters. This policy explains what data we process, how we use it, and the choices you have.

1. What We Process
- Usage data: in-app interactions, basic diagnostics and crash logs (if enabled by the OS).
- Content you provide: messages, character profiles, uploaded files for processing.
- Settings: language, AI provider selection, local/remote model preferences, API keys you explicitly enter.

2. Where Your Data Lives
- On-device: chat history, settings, locally generated character data and files are stored on your device using secure app storage.
- Cloud (only when you opt in): if you choose a cloud AI provider, prompts and message content are transmitted to that provider to generate responses.
- We do not run our own cloud back end for user profiles or analytics.

3. Local AI vs Cloud AI
- Local models: when you select a local model, processing happens entirely on-device. Your conversations are not sent to a server.
- Cloud models: when you select a cloud model, your messages and necessary context (e.g., system prompt and recent history) are sent to the chosen provider’s API strictly to fulfill your request.

4. API Keys
- You may enter your own API keys for third‑party AI providers. Keys are stored locally on your device in app storage and are used only to make requests you initiate.
- We never sell or share your keys. Do not share keys with others.

5. Files You Upload
- You may import files (e.g., PDF/TXT/DOC/DOCX/EML) to generate character cards. Files are processed locally when using local models.
- For cloud models, extracted text may be sent to the selected provider solely to generate outputs you requested. We do not store your files on our servers.

6. Data Retention
- On-device data persists until you delete it from Settings or uninstall the app.
- If you use a cloud provider, that provider’s retention policies apply to the requests you send. Review the provider’s policy for details.

7. Sharing
- We do not sell your personal data.
- We do not share your data with third parties except the AI provider you explicitly choose in Settings when you use cloud inference.

8. Security
- We use platform storage and recommended practices to protect local data.
- Transmissions to cloud AI providers use HTTPS.

9. Your Choices
- Choose local models to keep processing on-device.
- Switch providers or disable cloud usage at any time in Settings.
- Clear all local data in Settings > Data Management.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. We will update the “Last updated” date above and may provide in‑app notice of material changes.
